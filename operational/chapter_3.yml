           - h1: Using Execution Modules
           - ul:
             - What is an Execution Module
             - Documentation
             - Installing a package
             - Running Commands
             - Output print options

           - h2: What is an Execution Module
           - p: 'Execution modules are used when calling modules directly from the command line'
           - code: |
               salt '*' user.add fred uid gid groups home shell
           - class_notes: |
               1. Speak to how basic targeting is done, with just * for now.
               2. Talk about how Modules perform all the work for salt.
               3. Show how you would use a module via the command line.

           - h2: Documentation
           - p: "Salt's documentation is embeded inside and can be reach via command-line"
           - code: |
               salt '*' sys.doc
           - p: "Or you can run -d, --doc on newer versions of Salt."
           - code: |
               salt --doc
           - class_notes: |
               When in doubt, read the docs online; but know you have the at CLI.

           - h2: Installing a package
           - p: 'Installing a package from command-line very simple.  Just use pkg.install'
           - code: |
               salt '*' pkg.install cowsay
           - class_notes: |
               pkg.install is CLI and pkg.installed is used in state files.

           - h2: Lab
           - ul:
             - 'Install cowsay on your minions'
           - class_notes: |
              salt '*' pkg.install cowsay

           - h2: Running Commands
           - p: Running arbitrary commands can come in handy for one time operations. This is done with the cmd.run module<br/>
           - p: Execution Example
           - code: |
               salt '*' cmd.run 'cowsay HELLO EVERYBODY!'
           - p: or
           - code: |
              salt \* cmd.run 'tail /var/log/syslog'
           - class_notes: |
              cmd.run is just like running the command on the remote machine.

         -
           - h2: Lab
           - ul:
             - 'Disable your firewall using cmd.run'
           - class_notes: |
              1. salt '*' cmd.run 'iptables -F'
              2. Cannot be skipped

         -
           - h2: Output print options
           - p: Salt can print a large range of formatted outputs using the --out flag<br/>
           - code: |
               grains, highstate, json, key, overstatestage, pprint, raw, txt, yaml
           - class_notes: |
               salt '*' test.ping --out json<br/>
               To show that the test.ping is now JSONed

           - h2: Lab
           - ul:
             - 'Add an user named "thatch" using cmd.run with JSON output'
           - class_notes: |
              1. salt '*' user.add thatch
              2. This lab cannot be skipped, it is used later.
