               1. Speak to the community around configuration management. And the differeing tools out there.

           - ul:
             - Rackspace
             - Customers

             - You?
           - class_notes: |
               1. Give examples of how rackers have used salt. Example (heartbleed patching)
               2. Find examples of where customers have used salt or configuration management.
               3. See if any in the room have used salt.

           - h2: What could you use Salt for?
           - p: 'In small groups discuss otherways salt could help improve a customers infrastructure.'
           - p: 'See what examples you can come up with where configuration management like salt would have saved time or resources.'
           - class_notes: |
               1. Get the class involved. However they want to come up with use cases based on what the know now, which isnt much but the concepts should be imediately practical
